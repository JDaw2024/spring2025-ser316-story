On a sunny day in Berlin, I decided to visit the Schloss near the Hauptstrasse, dreaming of bratwurst and a trip to the Biergarten. 
I dressed up in my finest lederhose and hopped into my updated Series 2 BMW for a refreshing night out, comfortable with my newly fixed klimaanlage.
Just as I parked near the Schloss, a mischievous Hund wearing a tiny Dirndl jumped into my car and refused to leave until I shared my bratwurst.
