On a sunny day in Berlin, I decided to visit the Schloss near the Hauptstrasse, dreaming of bratwurst and a trip to the Biergarten. 
I dressed up in my finest lederhose and hopped into my updated Series 2 BMW for a refreshing night out, comfortable with my newly fixed klimaanlage.
Just as I parked near the Schloss, a mischievous Hund wearing a tiny Dirndl jumped into my car and refused to leave until I shared my bratwurst.
As I wrestled with the wettbewerbsfaehig Hund, he barked out a tune that suspiciously resembled "Du Hast" from Rammstein, as if we were at a live audition for the world's quirkiest rock band!
It was getting late, and after my friendly brawl with the suspicious Hund I invited it to the Baeckerei for some Gebaeck, Mehlhase, und Apfelkuchen. 
After I enjoyed some Apfelkuchen with the Hund, I decided to visit the Schloss Eltz where an elderly man was selling some Brot just outside the entrance.
